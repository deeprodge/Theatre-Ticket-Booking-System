## Challenges we ran into

- We weren't able to think of a way to store which seats are booked and which not.
- The size of movie posters were too large to display on button so we had to resize them.
- Too many tables in MySQL were used which made the program slower so we had to optimize by reducing and merging some of the tables


## What we learned

- How to handle and store data using MySQL.
- How to use Swing Controls of NetBeans to input and output data.
- How to send and retrive data from MySQL to NetBeans
- How to handle exceptions in Java using try/catch/throw.
